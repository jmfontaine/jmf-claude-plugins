# Claude Code Plugins

A collection of plugins for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) I
built these for my own use, but they might help you, either to use directly or as
inspiration for your own custom tools.

## Installation

In Claude Code, use the `/plugin` command to manage plugins:

```shell
# Add the plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/jmfontaine/jmf-claude-code-plugins

# Install the plugin collection
/plugin install jmf-claude-code-plugins

# Install a specific plugin from the collection
/plugin install <plugin>@jmf-claude-code-plugins
```

## Plugins
